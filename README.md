# Brainfuck-Compiler-C

**NOTE: I built this compiler for use on windows. I have no idea if it will work on other systems.**
    **Just make sure you have gcc installed and set to your PATH.**

## How to run
1. Write a brainfuck program, preferrably with the `.bf` file extension
2. If you use the packaged compiler, just run the following command:
    `BrainfuckCompile <path to brainfuck file> <output file name>`
3. Run your new, compiled brainfuck program

I've included "helloworld.bf" as an example for you to use to test your system.

## What is Brainfuck?
I have no idea how you got here, but you should probably look at [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck)
